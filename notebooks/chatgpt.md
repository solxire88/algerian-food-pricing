Here are **sample questions** a government or policy‑oriented stakeholder—one focused on **inflation monitoring**, **subsidy analysis**, or **price regulation**—might ask a data analyst working with your kind of commodity‑price dataset:

---

## 🏛 Inflation‑Monitoring

1. **“How would you construct a food‑price index (e.g. a CPI sub‑index) from raw commodity prices like potatoes, rice, eggs?”**
   *(This aligns with standard methods for constructing cost‑of‑living indices by weighting a basket of goods over time.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][1])

2. **“How would you identify and handle outliers or spikes in daily commodity prices when estimating month‑on‑month inflation?”**
   *(Interview experts often emphasise statistical identification—and careful treatment or removal—of outliers in cost‑of‑living data.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][1])

3. **“If national policy defines ‘core inflation’ as CPI ex‑food & energy, how would you define an analogous measure using your dataset? What limitations might it have?”**
   *(Cost‑of‑living analysts often contrast headline versus core inflation for accuracy.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][2])

4. **“Suppose a severe drought caused a persistent jump in cereal prices. How would you detect a structural break and adjust your inflation measurement accordingly?”**
   *(Time‑series models used in forecasting emphasize detecting and adjusting for structural breaks in trending series.)* ([skills.interviewgemini.com][3])

5. **“What indicator(s) would you compare against those you compute—headlines like producer price index (PPI), retail price inflation, or exchange‑rate‑adjusted prices—to validate your findings?”**
   *(Policy analysts routinely evaluate series like CPI, PPI, or GDP deflator in tandem.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][2])

## 💰 Subsidy Analysis

6. **“If the government introduces a minimum support price (MSP) for wheat or rice, how would you evaluate its effect on market prices in your dataset?”**
   *(Globally, analysts assess whether MSP or price‑floor policies raise consumer prices versus stabilise farm income.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][4])

7. **“What kinds of subsidy (input, production, price‑support) might you expect to show up in the data—and how would you differentiate them from secular food‑price trends?”**
   *(Economic‑analysis frameworks outline various types of agricultural support and their effects.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][4])

8. **“What impact might a subsidy removal or tariff change have on the volatility of commodity prices in your dataset, and how would you measure that?”**
   *(Market impact evaluations often include before‑and‑after volatility and level comparisons around policy changes.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][4])

9. **“How would you use your dataset to assess whether subsidies benefit consumers (via lower prices), incidental traders, or producers—across towns and commodity categories?”**
   *(Effective subsidy evaluation requires distributional analysis across regions and commodities.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][4])

## 🧾 Market Regulation & Price Controls

10. **“If the government imposes a price ceiling on the price of pasta or other staples, how would you detect its effect using only your price‑time‑series?”**
    *(Policy monitoring often uses data to detect whether enacted ceilings or floors bind and lead to shortages or surpluses.)* ([en.wikipedia.org][5])

11. **“How would you detect potential collusion or price coordination among town‑level players based on observed price movements in nearby markets?”**
    *(In regulated markets, analysts look for unusual price synchronization as a potential sign of coordination or lack of competition.)* ([wsj.com][6])

12. **“What supply‑demand diagnostics would you use to determine whether price changes stem from supply shocks, demand shifts, or speculative hoarding?”**
    *(Commodity analysts assess structural supply/demand shifts using historic volatility and external variables.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][7])

13. **“If analysis shows that price rises persist after a short‑term shock, how would you assess whether regulatory limits (ceilings/floors) are ineffective or mis‑targeted?”**
    *(Economists caution that price controls often fail to slow inflation and may cause market distortions if not carefully calibrated.)* ([en.wikipedia.org][5])

14. **“How could you use exploratory data from your dataset to suggest indicators (e.g. price thresholds or timeliness of spikes) that automatically trigger policy interventions?”**
    *(Policymakers often set price‑trigger thresholds; analysts need to backtest them on historic price behaviour.)* ([en.wikipedia.org][8])

---

## 📊 Forecasting & Policy Modeling

15. **“Which time‑series techniques (e.g. ARIMA, SARIMA, STL decomposition) would you use to forecast prices and expected inflation in coming months?”**
    *(Economic data scientists often rely on time‑series tools like ARIMA and seasonal decomposition for projection.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][9])

16. **“How would you incorporate policy variables—such as subsidy levels, MSP changes, or known disruptive events—into a forecasting model?”**
    *(Econometric models frequently include policy dummy variables for better accuracy.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][9])

17. **“How would you quantify the uncertainty around your inflation forecast and communicate that to policymakers?”**
    *(Sensitivity analysis and confidence intervals are recommended to show forecast risk and stability.)* ([https://resumegemini.com][9])

---

## 🧠 Policy Use Cases

– **“Can you draft a dashboard showing monthly food‑price inflation by category and region, highlighting items where inflation exceeds X% for Y consecutive months?”**
– **“Show how to detect early signs of persistent price inflation in key staples—before they affect headline inflation and trigger subsidy or monetary responses.”**
– **“If government intends to target subsidy removal or re‑allocation, what scenario analysis would you perform to estimate consumer price impact by commodity and location?”**

---

### Why these matter

Data analysts working in **government or policy contexts** must not only craft accurate statistical models but also anticipate **how that information will guide decisions**—from monetary policy to food subsidies, market regulation, and consumer protection. Each question is grounded in real‑world analytical needs: tracking inflation rigorously, understanding subsidy impact, ensuring markets function fairly, and building actionable insights for policymakers and regulators.
